  \cvsummary{
    I started studying Information Systems in a 3-year technical course in
    the Federal Center of Technologycal Education. As soon as I finished
    the technical course, I entered a Bachelor's degree in Information
    Systems, at the same institution. At that time, I was co-author of
    a short article published in Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and
    the Web (WebMedia), the main event of the theme in Brazil.

    I have been working with software development since 2012. In this
    period I have worked in desktop, web and mobile projects, but int
    the last years, I have focused on web development and on developing
    skills like automated deployment and tests.

    Today I continue to study with online courses, seeking to improve
    my skills.
