  I started studying Information Systems in a 3-year technical course in
  the Federal Center of Technologycal Education. As soon as I finished
  the technical course, I entered a Bachelor's degree in Information
  Systems, at the same institution. At that time, I was co-author of
  a short article published in Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and
  the Web (WebMedia), the main event of the theme in Brazil.

  I have been working with desktop, web and mobile applications development
  since 2013. In this period, I have been also dealing with continuous
  integration and continuous delivery, and managing resources on AWS.

  I seek to acquire knowledge and experience through new projects and courses,
  in addition to my work.
