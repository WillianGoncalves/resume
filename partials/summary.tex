  I started studying Information Systems in a 3-year technical course in
  the Federal Center of Technologycal Education. As soon as I finished
  the technical course, I entered a Bachelor's degree in Information
  Systems, at the same institution. At that time, I was co-author of
  a short article published in Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and
  the Web (WebMedia), the main event of the theme in Brazil.

  I have been working with software development since 2012. In this
  period I have worked in desktop, web and mobile projects, but int
  the last years, I have been focusing on web development and on developing
  skills like automated deployment and tests.

  Today, I continue to study with online courses, seeking to improve
  my skills.
